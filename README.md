## 3. Descriptive Analysis
Descriptive analysis is performed on selected elements. For instance:
- mean of price shows the average price for the entire table.
- Mode shows the item sold the most, which was burgers at 12.99 and fro the analysis on quantity it was sold 201 times.

## 4. Chart
A simple box and whisker plot was made from the table to show the pricing distribution by manager. This is essential because from the chart, all the boxes look similar which means theres a fairly uniform distribution of the pricing in all locations, since pricing will be determined from Headquarters.
However, looking at Joao, there are a number of outliers above the distribution, which indicates that there are certain prices  that he alone implements and this might need to be looked at by Management.

## 5.VLOOKUP
A vlookup function is implemented on our data to allow for the searching of a product based on the order number.

## 6.PIVOT TABLE
A pivot table is used to determine queries such as best selling product, revenue etc.
